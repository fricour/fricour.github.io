Roads (commuting, bikepacking and training) since 2017.

No car --- no engine (except sometimes the train) --- only freedom (and some pain but that's part of the fun).

```{r, fig.height = 10}

library(leaflet)
library(leafgl)

cycling <- sf::read_sf('data/cycling.geojson')

leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(provider = providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  fitBounds(lng1 = 0, lat1 = 40, lng2 = 10, lat2 = 50) |>
  addGlPolylines(data = cycling)

```
