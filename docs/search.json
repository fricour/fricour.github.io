    "text": "In our paper entitled Century-scale carbon sequestration flux throughout the ocean by the biological pump, we estimate that the flux of organic carbon that is sequestered for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years by the biological carbon pump (BCP) is 0.9-2.6 Pg C year\\(^{-1}\\). This estimation is up to 6 times larger than previous estimates based on the common assumption that sequestration only occurs in the deep ocean (i.e. typically below 1000 m).\nInstead, our study is based on the concept of continuous vertical sequestration, that we refer to as CONVERSE, which states that sequestration (for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years) can occur throughout the entire water column.\nThe present summary simplifies the published paper and makes it more reader-friendly. To do so, some of the text, data and results, which are essential for the primary publication, are not included, and our results are presented in an interactive way. This way our key results should be easy to understand by a broad range of readers.\n\nKeywords to keep in mind\nBefore going into details, let me define some keywords to understand the main points of our paper.\n\nDIC — dissolved inorganic carbon, composed of \\(CO_{2}\\), \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\), \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\) and \\(CO_{3}^{2-}\\).\nRemineralization — respiration of organic matter by organisms which consequently produce biogenic DIC (i.e. DIC\\(_{bio}\\)).\nPOC / DOC — particulate / dissolved organic carbon.\nBiological carbon pump (BCP) — series of ocean processes through which inorganic carbon is fixed as organic matter by photosynthesis in sunlit surface water and then transported to the ocean interior, and possibly the sediment, resulting in the storage of carbon (IPCC 2019).\nCarbon sequestration — it refers to a given time where DIC is hidden from the atmosphere. In our paper, we use the IPCC definition which states that 100 years is a period long enough to consider that this carbon is sequestered (i.e. stored away from the atmosphere).\n\\(f_{100}\\) — it represents the fraction of water at a given location and depth that will remain in the ocean for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years (Siegel et al. 2021). In other words, it represents the fraction of inorganic carbon in a water parcel that will remain hidden from the atmosphere for at least a century.\n\n\n\nA taste of \\(f_{100}\\)\nThe model of Siegel et al. (2021) returns \\(f_{100}\\) values in 48 oceanic layers, from the surface down to ~5500 m depth. Using the map below, you can observe the regional disparities of \\(f_{100}\\) at different depths and highlight regions of interest by saturating the colorbar (\\(f_{100}\\) ranges between 0 and 1).\n\nd3 = require(\"d3@7\")\n\nworld = FileAttachment(\"data_converse/countries-110m.json\").json()\nland = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.land)\n\n&lt;!-- Issue to read the big file from git lfs so hard solution: split the big file into 4 pieces --&gt; \n\n&lt;!-- f100_data = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_full.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; { --&gt;\n&lt;!--   const c = d3.geoCentroid(f); --&gt;\n&lt;!--   return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]}; --&gt;\n&lt;!-- })) --&gt;\n\nf100_data1 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part1.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data2 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part2.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data3 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part3.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data4 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part4.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data = [...f100_data1, ...f100_data2, ...f100_data3, ...f100_data4];\n\nviewof max_value1 = Inputs.range([0, 1], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nviewof f100_depth = Inputs.select(\n  [\n    5, 15, 25, 36, 48, 61, 75, 91,\n    109, 130, 153, 179, 209, 242,\n    279, 320, 365, 415, 470, 531,\n    597, 669, 747, 832, 923, 1022,\n    1128, 1241, 1363, 1493, 1631,\n    1778, 1935, 2101, 2277, 2462,\n    2658, 2865, 3083, 3312, 3552,\n    3804, 4068, 4345, 4634, 4937,\n    5253, 5582\n  ],\n  {label: \"depth (m)\", value: 531.0}\n)\n\nf100_filtered = f100_data.filter(data =&gt; data.depth == f100_depth);\n\nPlot.plot({\n  projection: {type: \"equal-earth\"},\n  color: {\n    scheme: \"BuPu\",\n    domain: [0, max_value1],\n    legend: true,\n    label: \"f100\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.raster(f100_filtered, {\n    fill: \"value\",\n    width: 180,\n    height: 91,\n    x1: -180,\n    y1: -90,\n    x2: 180,\n    y2: 90,\n    clip: \"sphere\",\n    interpolate: \"barycentric\"\n}),\n    Plot.geo(land, {fill: \"currentColor\", fillOpacity: 1}),\n    Plot.sphere(),\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that some regions (e.g. North Indian Ocean, Eastern Pacific, Antarctic margin) have \\(f_{100}\\) values above 0.5 at already ~500 m, indicating that the carbon sequestration flux would be underestimated in those regions if the traditional approach (i.e. sequestration assumed to occur below a fixed reference depth, typically 1000 m) was used. In contrast, other regions (e.g. North Eastern Atlantic, Antarctic Circumpolar Current) have \\(f_{100}\\) values below 0.5 at 1000 m. Following traditional metrics, we would therefore overestimate the carbon sequestration flux in those regions.\nUsing those \\(f_{100}\\) values, it is therefore possible to compute carbon sequestration fluxes (\\(F_{seq}\\)). For each water layer of thickness \\(\\Delta z\\), we need to compute the remineralization flux (\\(F_{remin}\\)), that is the flux of biogenic DIC, and multiply it by the corresponding \\(f_{100}\\) values to get the sequestration flux of biogenic DIC.\n\\[\nF_{seq}(\\Delta z) = F_{remin}(\\Delta z) \\times f_{100}(\\Delta z)\n\\]\nBased on that equation, it looks like we only need to compute \\(F_{remin}\\) and the work is over ! It is of course a little trickier.\n\n\nA new paradigm for the BCP\nIf you remember the definition of the BCP, it says […] organic matter […] transported to the ocean interior […]. The carbon flux leaving the euphotic zone (EZ, where there is enough light for photosynthesis to occur) for the ocean interior is referred to as the export flux. The export depth is often set at 100 m but can also be set at the base of the EZ.\nUntil recently, the transport of organic carbon was solely attributed to the gravitational settling of POC. However, Boyd et al. (2019) revised this assumption by adding new biological and physical mechanisms that inject sinking (i.e. POC) and suspended (i.e. DOC) particles at depth through the action of vertically migrating organisms and physical circulation (see figure below).\n\n\n\nConceptual representation of the three export pathways of the BCP \\(\\textcopyright\\)Thomas Boniface.\n\n\nThe BCP can therefore be seen as the combination of three export pathways:\n\nThe biological gravitational pump (BGP).\nThe biologically mediated particle injection pump (migrant pump), which consists in the direct injection of POC below the euphotic zone through the vertical migration of animals (on daily and seasonal time scales).\nThe physically mediated particle injection pump (mixing pump), composed of three separate pumps: the mixed layer pump, the eddy subduction pump and the large-scale subduction pump that directly inject DOC below the surface layer (i.e. euphotic zone).\n\nThe times indicated in this figure (10, 100 and 1000 years) can be understood as average residence times of carbon in the water column. Indeed, it is shown in our study that some fraction of the carbon exported by the three pathways can be sequestered at all depths throughout the water column, this fraction increasing with depth (see next section).\n\n\nContinuous vertical sequestration (CONVERSE)\nWhile the figure above correctly illustrates the three export pathways of the BCP, it still represents the old paradigm of sequestration, i.e. it only occurs at depth. However, the depth distribution of global median \\(f_{100}\\) values shows that \\(f_{100}\\) increases rapidly from the surface to \\(\\approx\\) 0.6 at 1000 m, and progressively up to 1 at the seafloor, indicating that 100% of remineralized DIC is retained for \\(\\ge\\) 100 years.\n\nf100_global_median = FileAttachment(\"data_converse/f100_global_median_average.csv\").csv({typed: true})\n&lt;!-- https://community.rstudio.com/t/observable-js-plot-error-in-quarto-document-plot-pointerx-is-not-a-function/172090/3 --&gt;\n&lt;!-- Plot = import(\"https://esm.sh/@observablehq/plot\") had to be changed, see https://github.com/observablehq/plot/issues/2022--&gt;\nPlot = import(\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/plot/+esm\")\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  marks: [\n    Plot.dot(f100_global_median, {x: \"f100\", y: \"depth\", fill: \"black\"}),\n    Plot.tip(f100_global_median, Plot.pointer({x: \"f100\", y: \"depth\"}))\n  ],\n  y: {domain: [5600, 0],\n      label: \"Depth (m)\"    \n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of this continuous sequestration by the BCP, we propose the following new conceptual representation of the BCP:\n\n\n\nRevised conceptual representation of the BCP \\(\\textcopyright\\) Laetitia Drago.\n\n\n\n\nA variety of CONVERSE versions\nThus, to estimate the global sequestration flux by the BCP, we needed to take into account the remineralization flux of each export pathway. For this, we used POC and DOC data derived from the model of DeVries and Weber (2017) as well as POC fluxes obtained from the best known relationship of Martin et al. (1987) — Martin’s Law — which describes (empirically) the attenuation of the sinking POC flux with depth.\n\\[\nF_{z} = F_{z_{export}} \\left(\\frac{z}{z_{export}}\\right)^{-b}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{z}\\), \\(z_{export}\\) and \\(b\\) are, respectively, the estimated POC flux at depth \\(z\\), the depth of the export flux and the remineralization factor.\nUsing different remineralization factors (fixed, local or regional), data sources, export flux (model data from Henson, Sanders, and Madsen (2012) or DeVries and Weber (2017)) export depths (100 m or base of EZ), we computed 7 distinct CONVERSE versions which are briefly resumed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONVERSE version\nExport depth\nRemineralization factor\nBGP1\nMixing pump1\nMigrant pump2\n\n\n\n\nC1\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC2\n100 m\nvariable\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC3\n100 m\nregional\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC4\nEZ base\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC5\n100 m\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC6\n100 m\n0.86\nexport ratio\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC7\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nderived from POC export\nderived from POC export\n\n\n\n1 To compare CONVERSE versions using different value of POC export flux, we used a scaling factor that we refer to as the export ratio, which is the ratio of the global POC export flux at 100 m from Henson et al., (2012) to the one from DeVries et al., (2017).\n\n\n2 For the diel migration pump, we used the POC export at 100 m while we used the POC flux at ~600m for the seasonal migration pump. However, the later is only based on data from the northern North Atlantic hence it is underestimated and will be neglected here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual tool to compare the 7 versions\nIf you read our paper (especially the supplementary material), you will quickly notice that we have lots of maps and tables which makes it sometimes difficult to compare the seven versions.\nTo improve the understanding of what’s going on between all CONVERSE versions, you will find below two little Earth that you can play with to focus on your area of interest.\nAvailable data (without CONVERSE duplicates, see previous table):\n\nBCP (= BGP + Mixing + Migrant) sequestration fluxes\nBGP, mixing and diel migrant pump sequestration fluxes\nPOC export flux at 100 m (two data sources) and at the EZ base\nPOC sequestration fluxes at 1000 m (i.e. fixed sequestration reference depth)\n\n\nviewof rotate2 = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.range([-180, 180], {step: 1, label: \"longitude\"}),\n  Inputs.range([-90, 90], {step: 1, label: \"latitude\"}),\n])\n\nviewof max_value2 = Inputs.range([0, 100], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nmaps = [\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (Henson et al., 2012)\", value: \"FexpH\"},\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpT\"},\n  {label: \"POC export EZ base (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpZeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C1/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C4\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C5\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C1/C2/C3\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C4\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C5\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C6\", value: \"FseqDOC_C6\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C7\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C1/C2/C3/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqMigrD_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqMigrD_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C1\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C2\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C3\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C4\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C5\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C6\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C6\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C7\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C1/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C4\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C6\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C6\"},\n]\n\nviewof left_data = Inputs.select(\n  maps, {label: \"left data\", format: x =&gt;

However, as explained earlier, the migrant pump is underestimated because we only have seasonal migration flux estimates for the northern North Atlantic.\nFinally, we computed that fluxes above 1000 and 2000 m accounts, respectively, for 47-68% and 66-88% of global CONVERSE carbon sequestration fluxes, which is substantial.\n\n\nConclusion\nCarbon sequestration is a concept that you might have heard in the news. It is related to the removal of carbon from interaction with the atmosphere. In this work, we have computed carbon sequestration (\\(\\geq\\) 100 years) fluxes for seven versions of CONVERSE, a framework that computes sequestration on the entire water column (i.e. continuous sequestration). In addition to the BGP, we also added the contribution to carbon sequestration by vertically migrating animals and physical mixing processes, with an estimated contribution of 21-34% to the BCP global sequestration flux, even though they do not transport carbon into the deep ocean.\nFinally, our calculations show that the 100-year carbon sequestration flux by the BCP is 2-3 or 3-6 times larger than what would be estimated using a fixed sequestration depth at, respectively, 1000 and 2000 m. Thus, the concept of continuous vertical sequestration should be applied to further studies to take into account the fact that using a fixed sequestration depth misses between 47 and 88% of the global sequestration flux.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBoyd, Philip W, Hervé Claustre, Marina Levy, David A Siegel, and Thomas Weber. 2019. “Multi-Faceted Particle Pumps Drive Carbon Sequestration in the Ocean.” Nature 568 (7752): 327–35. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1098-2.\n\n\nDeVries, Tim, and Thomas Weber. 2017. “The Export and Fate of Organic Matter in the Ocean: New Constraints from Combining Satellite and Oceanographic Tracer Observations.” Global Biogeochem.

    "text": "The Ocean’s Role in the Carbon Cycle: Understanding the Biological Carbon Pump\nThe ocean is known to play a key role in the carbon cycle. Without it, atmospheric CO2 levels would be much higher than they are today thanks to the presence of carbon pumps that maintain a gradient of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) between the surface and the deep ocean.\nThe biological carbon pump (BCP) is primarily responsible for this gradient. It consists in a series of ocean processes through which inorganic carbon is fixed as organic matter by photosynthesis in sunlit surface waters and then transported to the ocean interior and possibly the sediment where it will be sequestered from the atmosphere for millions of years. The BCP was long thought as solely the gravitational settling of particulate organic carbon (POC). However, a new paradigm for the BCP has recently been defined in which physically and biologically mediated particle injection pumps have been added to the original definition.\nPhysically mediated particle injection pumps provide a pathway to better understand the transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) whereas biologically mediated particle injection pumps focus on the transport of POC by vertically migrating animals, either daily or seasonally. Therefore, a better understanding of these processes could help bridge the gap between carbon leaving the surface and carbon demand in the ocean interior.\nTo address this new paradigm, this work will benefit from the advent of recent sensors that equip a new generation of Biogeochemical-Argo floats (BGC-Argo). The first part focuses on the development of an embedded zooplankton classification model for the Underwater Vision Profiler 6 (UVP6) under strict technical and energy constraints. The second part studies particle and carbon fluxes in the Labrador Sea using BGC-Argo floats equipped for the first time with the UVP6 and an optical sediment trap (OST), providing two independent measurements of sinking particles. The last part consists in revisiting the BCP using a new framework called CONVERSE for Continuous Vertical Sequestration. With this new approach, we re-evaluate the total carbon sequestered from the atmosphere (≥ 100 years) by the BCP and its transport pathways on the entire water column, in contrast to the carbon sequestration typically assumed below a fixed reference depth.\nKeywords: Carbon pumps – Underwater Vision Profiler 6 – BGC-Argo floats – Machine learning\n\n\nNote - click on F for full screen and O for an overview of the slide deck.
