    "text": "Hi, I am Florian !  I have a PhD in oceanography, but it turns out that I’m more of a data expert than an ocean expert. During my PhD, I developed an automatic zooplankton classification model using machine learning tools for on-board cameras in autonomous underwater vehicles. For this, I developed a python package called uvpec to train different image classification models for the Underwater Vision Profiler 6. Working with Big Data was also part of the job so I started to develop a bunch of Shiny apps (e.g. REFINE, CARBON and APPERO) to better visualize and try to better understand the carbon dynamics of the ocean at local and global scales. In my spare time, I try to keep up with the latest geeky thing, mostly from Posit (ex-RStudio) and web app development (mostly Shiny) as well as data vizualisation. Lastly, I ride my bike. A lot."
