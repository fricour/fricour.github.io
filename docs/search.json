    "text": "Hi, I am Florian !  I have a PhD in oceanography, but it turns out that I’m more of a data expert than an ocean expert. During my PhD, I developed an automatic zooplankton classification model using machine learning tools for on-board cameras in autonomous underwater vehicles. For this, I developed a python package called uvpec to train different image classification models for the Underwater Vision Profiler 6. Working with Big Data was also part of the job so I started to develop a bunch of Shiny apps (e.g. REFINE, CARBON and ARGO to better visualize and try to better understand the carbon dynamics of the ocean at local and global scales. In my spare time, I try to keep up with the latest geeky thing, mostly from Posit (ex-RStudio) and web app development (mostly Shiny) as well as data vizualisation. Lastly, I ride my bike. A lot."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Century-scale biological carbon sequestration flux\nIn our paper entitled Century-scale carbon sequestration flux throughout the ocean by the biological pump, we estimate that the flux of organic carbon that is sequestered for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years by the biological carbon pump (BCP) is 0.9-2.6 Pg C year\\(^{-1}\\). This estimation is up to 6 times larger than previous estimates based on the common assumption that sequestration only occurs in the deep ocean (i.e. typically below 1000 m).\nInstead, our study is based on the concept of continuous vertical sequestration, that we refer to as CONVERSE, which states that sequestration (for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years) can occur throughout the entire water column.\nWhile this work is published, I feel like something is missing. Based on my experience with scientific literature, I would say that it is not uncommon to encounter those issues when you write a paper:\n\nToo much text and you don’t want to throw away half of your research so you write (lots of) pages of supplementary material.\nFigures are static hence it is sometimes difficult to “feel” the data.\nFigures and tables are too big or too complicated because you don’t want to go back to point 1.\n\nTherefore, by writing this summary, I hope to bring some data interactivity and a clearer understanding of our results.\n\n\nKeywords to keep in mind\nBefore going into details, let me define some keywords to understand the main points of our paper.\n\nDIC — dissolved inorganic carbon, composed of \\(CO_{2}\\), \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\), \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\) and \\(CO_{3}^{2-}\\).\nRemineralization — respiration of organic matter by organisms which consequently produce biogenic DIC (i.e. DIC\\(_{bio}\\)).\nPOC / DOC — particulate / dissolved organic carbon.\nBiological carbon pump (BCP) — series of ocean processes through which inorganic carbon is fixed as organic matter by photosynthesis in sunlit surface water and then transported to the ocean interior, and possibly the sediment, resulting in the storage of carbon (IPCC 2019).\nCarbon sequestration — it refers to a given time where DIC is hidden from the atmosphere. In our paper, we use the IPCC definition which states that 100 years is a period long enough to consider that this carbon is sequestered (i.e. stored away from the atmosphere).\n\\(f_{100}\\) — it represents the fraction of water at a given location and depth that will remain in the ocean for \\(\\geq\\) 100 years (Siegel et al. 2021). In other words, it represents the fraction of inorganic carbon in a water parcel that will remain hidden from the atmosphere for at least a century.\n\n\n\nA taste of \\(f_{100}\\)\nThe model of Siegel et al. (2021) returns \\(f_{100}\\) values in 48 oceanic layers, from the surface down to ~5500 m depth. Using the map below, you can observe the regional disparities of \\(f_{100}\\) at different depths and highlight regions of interest by saturating the colorbar (\\(f_{100}\\) ranges between 0 and 1).\n\nd3 = require(\"d3@7\")\n\nworld = FileAttachment(\"data_converse/countries-110m.json\").json()\nland = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.land)\n\nf100_data = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_full.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nviewof max_value1 = Inputs.range([0, 1], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nviewof f100_depth = Inputs.select(\n  [\n    5, 15, 25, 36, 48, 61, 75, 91,\n    109, 130, 153, 179, 209, 242,\n    279, 320, 365, 415, 470, 531,\n    597, 669, 747, 832, 923, 1022,\n    1128, 1241, 1363, 1493, 1631,\n    1778, 1935, 2101, 2277, 2462,\n    2658, 2865, 3083, 3312, 3552,\n    3804, 4068, 4345, 4634, 4937,\n    5253, 5582\n  ],\n  {label: \"depth (m)\", value: 531.0}\n)\n\nf100_filtered = f100_data.filter(data =&gt; data.depth == f100_depth);\n\nPlot.plot({\n  projection: {type: \"equal-earth\"},\n  color: {\n    scheme: \"BuPu\",\n    domain: [0, max_value1],\n    legend: true,\n    label: \"f100\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.raster(f100_filtered, {\n    fill: \"value\",\n    width: 180,\n    height: 91,\n    x1: -180,\n    y1: -90,\n    x2: 180,\n    y2: 90,\n    clip: \"sphere\",\n    interpolate: \"barycentric\"\n}),\n    Plot.geo(land, {fill: \"currentColor\", fillOpacity: 1}),\n    Plot.sphere(),\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that some regions (e.g. North Indian Ocean, Eastern Pacific, Antarctic margin) have \\(f_{100}\\) values above 0.5 at already ~500 m, indicating that the carbon sequestration flux would be underestimated in those regions if the traditional approach (i.e. sequestration assumed to occur below a fixed reference depth, typically 1000 m) was used. In contrast, other regions (e.g. North Eastern Atlantic, Antarctic Circumpolar Current) have \\(f_{100}\\) values below 0.5 at 1000 m. Following traditional metrics, we would therefore overestimate the carbon sequestration flux in those regions.\nUsing those \\(f_{100}\\) values, it is therefore possible to compute carbon sequestration fluxes (\\(F_{seq}\\)). For each water layer of thickness \\(\\Delta z\\), we need to compute the remineralization flux (\\(F_{remin}\\)), that is the flux of biogenic DIC, and multiply it by the corresponding \\(f_{100}\\) values to get the sequestration flux of biogenic DIC.\n\\[\nF_{seq}(\\Delta z) = F_{remin}(\\Delta z) \\times f_{100}(\\Delta z)\n\\]\nBased on that equation, it looks like we only need to compute \\(F_{remin}\\) and the work is over ! It is of course a little trickier.\n\n\nA new paradigm for the BCP\nIf you remember the definition of the BCP, it says […] organic matter […] transported to the ocean interior […]. The carbon flux leaving the euphotic zone (EZ, where there is enough light for photosynthesis to occur) for the ocean interior is referred to as the export flux. The export depth is often set at 100 m but can also be set at the base of the EZ.\nUntil recently, the transport of organic carbon was solely attributed to the gravitational settling of POC. However, Boyd et al. (2019) revised this assumption by adding new biological and physical mechanisms that inject sinking (i.e. POC) and suspended (i.e. DOC) particles at depth through the action of vertically migrating organisms and physical circulation (see figure below).\n\n\n\nConceptual representation of the three export pathways of the BCP \\(\\textcopyright\\)Thomas Boniface.\n\n\nThe BCP can therefore be seen as the combination of three export pathways:\n\nThe biological gravitational pump (BGP).\nThe biologically mediated particle injection pump (migrant pump), which consists in the direct injection of POC below the euphotic zone through the vertical migration of animals (on daily and seasonal time scales).\nThe physically mediated particle injection pump (mixing pump), composed of three separate pumps: the mixed layer pump, the eddy subduction pump and the large-scale subduction pump that directly inject DOC below the surface layer (i.e. euphotic zone).\n\n\n\nA variety of CONVERSE versions\nThus, to estimate the global sequestration flux by the BCP, we needed to take into account the remineralization flux of each export pathway. For this, we used POC and DOC data derived from the model of DeVries and Weber (2017) as well as POC fluxes obtained from the best known relationship of Martin et al. (1987) — Martin’s Law — which describes (empirically) the attenuation of the sinking POC flux with depth.\n\\[\nF_{z} = F_{z_{export}} \\left(\\frac{z}{z_{export}}\\right)^{-b}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{z}\\), \\(z_{export}\\) and \\(b\\) are, respectively, the estimated POC flux at depth \\(z\\), the depth of the export flux and the remineralization factor.\nUsing different remineralization factors (fixed, local or regional), data sources (model data or empirical), export flux (model data from Henson, Sanders, and Madsen (2012) or DeVries and Weber (2017)) export depths (100 m or base of EZ), we computed 7 distinct CONVERSE versions which are briefly resumed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONVERSE version\nExport depth\nRemineralization factor\nBGP1\nMixing pump1\nMigrant pump2\n\n\n\n\nC1\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC2\n100 m\nvariable\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC3\n100 m\nregional\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC4\nEZ base\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC5\n100 m\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC6\n100 m\n0.86\nexport ratio\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC7\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nderived from POC export\nderived from POC export\n\n\n\n1 To compare CONVERSE versions using different value of POC export flux, we used a scaling factor that we refer to as the export ratio, which is the ratio of the global POC export flux at 100 m from Henson et al., (2012) to the one from DeVries et al., (2017).\n\n\n2 For the diel migration pump, we used the POC export at 100 m while we used the POC flux at ~600m for the seasonal migration pump. However, the later is only based on data from the northern North Atlantic hence it is underestimated and will be neglected here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual tool to compare the 7 versions\nIf you read our paper (especially the supplementary material), you will quickly notice that we have lots of maps and tables which makes it sometimes difficult to compare the seven versions.\nTo improve the understanding of what’s going on between all CONVERSE versions, you will find below two little Earth that you can play with to focus on your area of interest.\nAvailable data (without CONVERSE duplicates, see previous table):\n\nBCP (= BGP + Mixing + Migrant) sequestration fluxes\nBGP, mixing and diel migrant pump sequestration fluxes\nPOC export flux at 100 m (two data sources) and at the EZ base\nPOC sequestration fluxes at 1000 m (i.e. fixed sequestration reference depth)\n\n\nviewof rotate2 = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.range([-180, 180], {step: 1, label: \"longitude\"}),\n  Inputs.range([-90, 90], {step: 1, label: \"latitude\"}),\n])\n\nviewof max_value2 = Inputs.range([0, 100], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nmaps = [\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (Henson et al., 2012)\", value: \"FexpH\"},\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpT\"},\n  {label: \"POC export EZ base (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpZeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C1/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C4\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C5\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C1/C2/C3\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C4\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C5\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C6\", value: \"FseqDOC_C6\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C7\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C1/C2/C3/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqMigrD_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqMigrD_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C1\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C2\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C3\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C4\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C5\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C6\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C6\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C7\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C1/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C4\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C6\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C6\"},\n]\n\nviewof left_data = Inputs.select(\n  maps, {label: \"left data\", format: x =&gt;

Using the map below, you can observe the regional disparities of \\(f_{100}\\) at different depths and highlight regions of interest by saturating the colorbar (\\(f_{100}\\) ranges between 0 and 1).\n\nd3 = require(\"d3@7\")\n\nworld = FileAttachment(\"data_converse/countries-110m.json\").json()\nland = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.land)\n\n&lt;!-- Issue to read the big file from git lfs so hard solution: split the big file into 4 pieces --&gt; \n\n&lt;!-- f100_data = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_full.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; { --&gt;\n&lt;!--   const c = d3.geoCentroid(f); --&gt;\n&lt;!--   return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]}; --&gt;\n&lt;!-- })) --&gt;\n\nf100_data1 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part1.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data2 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part2.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data3 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part3.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data4 = d3.json(\"data_converse/f100_part4.geojson\").then(d =&gt; d.features.map(f =&gt; {\n  const c = d3.geoCentroid(f);\n  return {value: f.properties.value, depth: f.properties.depth, longitude: c[0], latitude: c[1]};\n}))\n\nf100_data = [...f100_data1, ...f100_data2, ...f100_data3, ...f100_data4];\n\nviewof max_value1 = Inputs.range([0, 1], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nviewof f100_depth = Inputs.select(\n  [\n    5, 15, 25, 36, 48, 61, 75, 91,\n    109, 130, 153, 179, 209, 242,\n    279, 320, 365, 415, 470, 531,\n    597, 669, 747, 832, 923, 1022,\n    1128, 1241, 1363, 1493, 1631,\n    1778, 1935, 2101, 2277, 2462,\n    2658, 2865, 3083, 3312, 3552,\n    3804, 4068, 4345, 4634, 4937,\n    5253, 5582\n  ],\n  {label: \"depth (m)\", value: 531.0}\n)\n\nf100_filtered = f100_data.filter(data =&gt; data.depth == f100_depth);\n\nPlot.plot({\n  projection: {type: \"equal-earth\"},\n  color: {\n    scheme: \"BuPu\",\n    domain: [0, max_value1],\n    legend: true,\n    label: \"f100\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.raster(f100_filtered, {\n    fill: \"value\",\n    width: 180,\n    height: 91,\n    x1: -180,\n    y1: -90,\n    x2: 180,\n    y2: 90,\n    clip: \"sphere\",\n    interpolate: \"barycentric\"\n}),\n    Plot.geo(land, {fill: \"currentColor\", fillOpacity: 1}),\n    Plot.sphere(),\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that some regions (e.g. North Indian Ocean, Eastern Pacific, Antarctic margin) have \\(f_{100}\\) values above 0.5 at already ~500 m, indicating that the carbon sequestration flux would be underestimated in those regions if the traditional approach (i.e. sequestration assumed to occur below a fixed reference depth, typically 1000 m) was used. In contrast, other regions (e.g. North Eastern Atlantic, Antarctic Circumpolar Current) have \\(f_{100}\\) values below 0.5 at 1000 m. Following traditional metrics, we would therefore overestimate the carbon sequestration flux in those regions.\nUsing those \\(f_{100}\\) values, it is therefore possible to compute carbon sequestration fluxes (\\(F_{seq}\\)). For each water layer of thickness \\(\\Delta z\\), we need to compute the remineralization flux (\\(F_{remin}\\)), that is the flux of biogenic DIC, and multiply it by the corresponding \\(f_{100}\\) values to get the sequestration flux of biogenic DIC.\n\\[\nF_{seq}(\\Delta z) = F_{remin}(\\Delta z) \\times f_{100}(\\Delta z)\n\\]\nBased on that equation, it looks like we only need to compute \\(F_{remin}\\) and the work is over ! It is of course a little trickier.\n\n\nA new paradigm for the BCP\nIf you remember the definition of the BCP, it says […] organic matter […] transported to the ocean interior […]. The carbon flux leaving the euphotic zone (EZ, where there is enough light for photosynthesis to occur) for the ocean interior is referred to as the export flux. The export depth is often set at 100 m but can also be set at the base of the EZ.\nUntil recently, the transport of organic carbon was solely attributed to the gravitational settling of POC. However, Boyd et al. (2019) revised this assumption by adding new biological and physical mechanisms that inject sinking (i.e. POC) and suspended (i.e. DOC) particles at depth through the action of vertically migrating organisms and physical circulation (see figure below).\n\n\n\nConceptual representation of the three export pathways of the BCP \\(\\textcopyright\\)Thomas Boniface.\n\n\nThe BCP can therefore be seen as the combination of three export pathways:\n\nThe biological gravitational pump (BGP).\nThe biologically mediated particle injection pump (migrant pump), which consists in the direct injection of POC below the euphotic zone through the vertical migration of animals (on daily and seasonal time scales).\nThe physically mediated particle injection pump (mixing pump), composed of three separate pumps: the mixed layer pump, the eddy subduction pump and the large-scale subduction pump that directly inject DOC below the surface layer (i.e. euphotic zone).\n\n\n\nA variety of CONVERSE versions\nThus, to estimate the global sequestration flux by the BCP, we needed to take into account the remineralization flux of each export pathway. For this, we used POC and DOC data derived from the model of DeVries and Weber (2017) as well as POC fluxes obtained from the best known relationship of Martin et al. (1987) — Martin’s Law — which describes (empirically) the attenuation of the sinking POC flux with depth.\n\\[\nF_{z} = F_{z_{export}} \\left(\\frac{z}{z_{export}}\\right)^{-b}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{z}\\), \\(z_{export}\\) and \\(b\\) are, respectively, the estimated POC flux at depth \\(z\\), the depth of the export flux and the remineralization factor.\nUsing different remineralization factors (fixed, local or regional), data sources (model data or empirical), export flux (model data from Henson, Sanders, and Madsen (2012) or DeVries and Weber (2017)) export depths (100 m or base of EZ), we computed 7 distinct CONVERSE versions which are briefly resumed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONVERSE version\nExport depth\nRemineralization factor\nBGP1\nMixing pump1\nMigrant pump2\n\n\n\n\nC1\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC2\n100 m\nvariable\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC3\n100 m\nregional\nMartin's Law\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC4\nEZ base\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC5\n100 m\n-\nmodel data\nmodel data\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC6\n100 m\n0.86\nexport ratio\nexport ratio\nderived from POC export\n\n\nC7\n100 m\n0.86\nMartin's Law\nderived from POC export\nderived from POC export\n\n\n\n1 To compare CONVERSE versions using different value of POC export flux, we used a scaling factor that we refer to as the export ratio, which is the ratio of the global POC export flux at 100 m from Henson et al., (2012) to the one from DeVries et al., (2017).\n\n\n2 For the diel migration pump, we used the POC export at 100 m while we used the POC flux at ~600m for the seasonal migration pump. However, the later is only based on data from the northern North Atlantic hence it is underestimated and will be neglected here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual tool to compare the 7 versions\nIf you read our paper (especially the supplementary material), you will quickly notice that we have lots of maps and tables which makes it sometimes difficult to compare the seven versions.\nTo improve the understanding of what’s going on between all CONVERSE versions, you will find below two little Earth that you can play with to focus on your area of interest.\nAvailable data (without CONVERSE duplicates, see previous table):\n\nBCP (= BGP + Mixing + Migrant) sequestration fluxes\nBGP, mixing and diel migrant pump sequestration fluxes\nPOC export flux at 100 m (two data sources) and at the EZ base\nPOC sequestration fluxes at 1000 m (i.e. fixed sequestration reference depth)\n\n\nviewof rotate2 = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.range([-180, 180], {step: 1, label: \"longitude\"}),\n  Inputs.range([-90, 90], {step: 1, label: \"latitude\"}),\n])\n\nviewof max_value2 = Inputs.range([0, 100], {step: 0.05, label: \"max colorbar\"})\n\nmaps = [\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (Henson et al., 2012)\", value: \"FexpH\"},\n  {label: \"POC export 100 m (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpT\"},\n  {label: \"POC export EZ base (DeVries et al., 2017)\", value: \"FexpZeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C1/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C4\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BGP - C5\", value: \"FseqPOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C1/C2/C3\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C4\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C5\", value: \"FseqDOC_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C6\", value: \"FseqDOC_C6\"},\n  {label: \"Mixing - C7\", value: \"FseqDOC_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C1/C2/C3/C6/C7\", value: \"FseqMigrD_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Migrant - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqMigrD_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C1\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C2\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C3\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C4\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_Zeu\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C5\", value: \"FseqBCPs_ST_100m\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C6\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C6\"},\n  {label: \"BCP - C7\", value: \"FseqBCPs_H_100m_C7\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C1/C7\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_martin\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C2\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_henson\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C3\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_guidi\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C4/C5\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C4\"},\n  {label: \"Fseq@1000 m - C6\", value: \"FseqPOC1000m_C6\"},\n]\n\nviewof left_data = Inputs.select(\n  maps, {label: \"left data\", format: x =&gt;
